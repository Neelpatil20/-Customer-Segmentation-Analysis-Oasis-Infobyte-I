Customer Segmentation: Applied K-Means Clustering to identify distinct customer groups.

Data Visualization: Used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize customer segments using scatter plots, histograms, and cluster heatmaps.

Insights & Recommendations: Interpreted clusters and recommended strategies like loyalty rewards, personalized offers, and re-engagement campaigns.

📚 Learning Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience with unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering).

Strengthened skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Learned to communicate insights through effective visualizations.
